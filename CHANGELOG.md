mPDF 5.7.1
================
## 01/09/2013

1) FILES: mpdf.php

Bug fix; Dollar sign enclosed by `<pre>` tag causing error.
Test e.g.: `<pre>Test $1.00 Test</pre> <pre>Test $2.00 Test</pre> <pre>Test $3.00 Test</pre> <pre>Test $4.00 Test</pre>`

-----------------------------

2) FILES: includes/functions.php AND mpdf.php

Changes to `preg_replace` with `/e` modifier to use `preg_replace_callback`
(/e depracated from PHP 5.5)

-----------------------------

3) FILES: classes/barcode.php

Small change to function `barcode_c128()` which allows ASCII 0 - 31 to be used in C128A e.g. chr(13) in:
`<barcode code="5432&#013;1068" type="C128A" />`

-----------------------------

4) FILES: mpdf.php

Using $use_kwt ("keep-[heading]-with-table") if `<h4></h4>` before table is on 2 lines and pagebreak occurs after first line
the first line is displayed at the bottom of the 2nd page.
Edited so that $use_kwt only works if the HEADING is only one line. Else ignores (but prints correctly)

-----------------------------

5) FILES: mpdf.php

Clearing old temporary files from `_MPDF_TEMP_PATH` will now ignore "hidden" files e.g. starting with a "`.`" `.htaccess`, `.gitignore` etc.
and also leave `dummy.txt` alone


mPDF 5.7
===========================

### 14/07/2013

Files changed
-------------
- config.php
- mpdf.php
- classes/tocontents.php
- classes/cssmgr.php
- classes/svg.php
- includes/functions.php
- includes/out.php
- examples/formsubmit.php [Important - Security update]

Updated Example Files in /examples/
-----------------------------------

- All example files
- mpdfstyleA4.css

config.php
----------

Removed:
- $this->hyphenateTables
- $this->hyphenate
- $this->orphansAllowed
Edited:
- "hyphens: manual" - Added to $this->defaultCSS
- $this->allowedCSStags now includes '|TEXTCIRCLE|DOTTAB'
New:
- $this->decimal_align = array('DP'=>'.', 'DC'=>',', 'DM'=>"\xc2\xb7", 'DA'=>"\xd9\xab", 'DD'=>'-');
- $this->h2toc = array('H1'=>0, 'H2'=>1, 'H3'=>2);
- $this->h2bookmarks = array('H1'=>0, 'H2'=>1, 'H3'=>2);
- $this->CJKforceend = false; // Forces overflowng punctuation to hang outside right margin (used with CJK script)


Backwards compatability
-----------------------

Changes in mPDF 5.7 may cause some changes to the way your documents appear. There are two main differences:
1) Hyphenation. To retain appearance compatible with earlier versions, set the CSS property "hyphens: auto" whenever
    you previously used $mpdf->hyphenate=true;
2) Table of Contents - appearance can now be controlled with CSS styles. By default, in mPDF 5.7, no styling is applied so you will get:
    - No indent (previous default of 5mm) - ($tocindent is ignored)
    - Any font, font-size set ($tocfont or $tocfontsize) will not work
    - HyperLinks will appear with your default appearance - usually blue and underlined
    - line spacing will be narrower (can use line-height or margin-top in CSS)

- Use of `<dottab>` enhanced by custom CSS "outdent" property
- Image HTML attributes `<img>` added: max-height, max-width, min-height and min-width
- Spotcolor can now be defined as it is used e.g. color: spot(PANTONE 534 EC, 100%, 85, 65, 47, 9);
- Lists - added support for "start" attribute in `<ol>` e.g. `<ol start="5">`
- Hyphenation controlled using CSS, consistent with CSS3 spec.
- Line breaking improved to avoid breaks within words where HTML tags are used e.g. H<sub>2<sub>0
- Line breaking in CJK scripts improved (and ability to force hanging punctuation)
- Numerals in a CJK script are kept together
- RTL improved support for phrases containing numerals and \ and /
- Bidi override codes supported - Right-to-Left Embedding [RLE] U+202B, Left-to-Right Embedding [LRE] U+202A,
    U+202C POP DIRECTIONAL FORMATTING (PDF)
- Support for `<base href="">` in HTML - uses it to SetBasePath for relative URLs.
- HTML tag - added support for `<wbr>` or `<wbr />` - converted to a soft-hyphen

- text-outline, text-outline-width and text-outline-color supported everywhere except in tables (blur not supported)
- background-origin, background-size, background-clip are now supported everywhere except in tables
- "visibility: hidden|visible|printonly|screenonly" for inline elements e.g. `<span>`
- Colors: device-cmyk(c,m,y,k) as per CSS3 spec. For consistency, device-cmyka also supported (not CSS3 spec)
- "z-index" can be used to utilise layers in the PDF document
- Custom CSS property added: "outdent" - opposite of indent

The HTML elements `<dottab>` and `<textcircle>` can now have CSS properties applied to them.

Bug fixes
---------
- SVG images - path including e.g. 1.234E-15 incorrectly parsed (not recognising capital E)
- Tables - if a table starts when the Y position on page is below bottom margin caused endless loop
- Float-ing DIVs - starting a float at bottom of page and it causes page break before anything output, second new page is forced
- Tables - Warning notice now given in Table footer or header if `<tfoot>` placed after `<tbody>` and table spans page
- Columns - block with border-width wider than the length of the border line, line overflows
- Columns - block with no padding containing a block with borders but no backgound colour, borders not printed
- Table in Columns - when background color set by surrounding block element - colour missing for height of half bottom border.
- TOCpagebreakByArray() when called by function was not adding the pagebreak
- Border around block element - dashed not showing correctly (not resetting linewidth between different edges)
- Double border in table - when background colour set in surrounding block element - shows as black line between the 2 bits of double
- Borders around DIVs - "double" border problem if not all 4 sides equally - fixed
- Borders around DIVs - solid (and double) borders overlap as in tables - now fixed so mitred joins as in browser
    [Inadvertently improves borders in Columns because of change in LineCap]
- Page numbering - $mpdf->pagenumSuffix etc not suppressed in HTML headers/footers if number suppressed
- Page numbering - Page number total {nbpg} incorrect  - e.g. showing decreasing numbers through document, when ToC present
- RTL numerals - incorrectly reversing a number followed by a comma
- Transform to uppercase/lowercase not working for chars > ASCII 128 when using core fonts
- TOCpagebreak - Not setting TOC-FOOTER
- TOCpagebreak - toc-even-header-name etc. not working
- Parsing some relative URLs incorrectly
- Textcircle - when moved to next page by "page-break-inside: avoid"
- Bookmarks will now work if jump more than one level e.g. 0,2,1  Inserts a new blank entry at level 1
- Paths to img or stylesheets - incorrectly reading "//www.domain.com" i.e. when starting with two /
- data:image as background url() - incorrectly adjusting path on server if MPDF_PATH not specified (included in release mPDF 5.6.1)
- Image problem if spaces or commas in path using http:// URL (included in release mPDF 5.6.1)
- Image URL parsing rewritten to handle both urlencoded URLs and not urlencoded (included in release mPDF 5.6.1)
- `<dottab>` fixed to allow color, font-size and font-family to be correctly used, avoid dots being moved to new page, and to work in RTL
- Table {colsum} summed figures in table header
- list-style-type (custom) colour not working
- `<tocpagebreak>` toc-preHTML and toc-postHTML can now contain quotes

New features / Improvements
---------------------------
CSS support added for for min-height, min-width, max-height and max-width in `<img>`

Images embedded in CSS

HTML5 tags supported
- as generic block elements: `<article><aside><details><figure><figcaption><footer><header><hgroup><nav><section><summary>`
- as in-line elements: `<mark><time><meter><progress>`
- `<mark>` has a default CSS set in config.php to yellow highlight

- custom appearances for `<meter>` and `<progress>` can be made by editing `classes/meter.php` file
- `<meter>` and `<progress>` suppress text inside the tags

Textcircle/Circular
- font: "auto" added: automatically sizes text to fill semicircle (if both set) or full circle (if only one set)
    NB for this AND ALL CSS on `<textcircle>`: does not inherit CSS styles
- attribute: divider="[characters including HTML entities]" added
- `<textcircle r="30mm" top-text="Text Circular Text Circular" bottom-text="Text Circular Text Circular"
    divider="&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;" style="font-size: auto" />`

&raquo; &rsquo; &sbquo; &bdquo; are now included in "orphan"-management at the end of lines

Improved CJK line wrapping (if CJK character at end of line, breaks there rather than previous wordspace)

NB mPDF 5.5 added support for `<fieldset>` and `<legend>` (omitted from ChangeLog)

Bug fixes
---------

- embedded fonts: Panose string incorrectly output as decimals - changed to hexadecimal
    Only a problem in limited circumstances.
    *****Need to delete all ttfontdata/ files in order for fix to have effect.
- `<textCircle>` background white even when set to none/transparent
- border="0" causing mPDF to add border to table CELLS as well as table
- iteration counter in THEAD crashed in some circumstances

- CJK not working in table following changes made in v5.4
- images fixed to work with Google Chart API (now mPDF does not urldecode the query part of the src)
- CSS `<style>` within HTML page crashed if CSS is too large  (? > 32Kb)
- SVG image nested int eht HTML failed to show if code too large (? > 32Kb)
- cyrillic character p &#1088; at end of table cell caused cell height to be incorrectly calculated

mPDF 5.5
===========================

### 02/03/2012

Files changed
-------------

- mpdf.php
- classes/ttfontsuni.php
- classes/svg.php
- classes/tocontents.php
- config.php
- config_fonts.php
- utils/font_collections.php
- utils/font_coverage.php

Files added

classes/ttfontsuni_analysis.php

config.php changes
------------------

To avoid just the border/background-color of the (empty) end of a block being moved on to next page (`</div></div>`)

`$this->margBuffer = 0; // Allow an (empty) end of block to extend beyond the bottom margin by this amount (mm)`

config_fonts.php changes
------------------------

Added to (arabic) fonts to allow "use non-mapped Arabic Glyphs" e.g. for Pashto
    'unAGlyphs' => true,

Arabic text
-----------

Arabic text (RTL) rewritten with improved support for Pashto/Sindhi/Urdu/Kurdish
    Presentation forms added:
    U+0649, U+0681, U+0682, U+0685, U+069A-U+069E, U+06A0, U+06A2, U+06A3, U+06A5, U+06AB-U+06AE,
    U+06B0-U+06B4, U+06B5-U+06B9, U+06BB, U+06BC, U+06BE, U+06BF, U+06C0, U+06CD, U+06CE, U+06D1, U+06D3, U+0678
    Joining improved:
    U+0672, U+0675, U+0676, U+0677, U+0679-U+067D, U+067F, U+0680, U+0683, U+0684, U+0687, U+0687, U+0688-U+0692,
    U+0694, U+0695, U+0697, U+0699, U+068F, U+06A1, U+06A4, U+06A6, U+06A7, U+06A8, U+06AA, U+06BA, U+06C2-U+06CB, U+06CF

Note - Some characters in Pashto/Sindhi/Urdu/Kurdish do not have Unicode values for the final/initial/medial forms of the characters.
However, some fonts include these characters "un-mapped" to Unicode (including XB Zar and XB Riyaz, which are bundled with mPDF).
    `'unAGlyphs' => true`, added to the config_fonts.php file for appropriate fonts will

This requires the font file to include a Format 2.0 POST table which references the glyphs as e.g. uni067C.med or uni067C.medi:
    e.g. XB Riyaz, XB Zar, Arabic Typesetting (MS), Arial (MS)

NB If you want to know if a font file is suitable, you can open a .ttf file in a text editor and search for "uni067C.med" - if it exists, it may work!
Using "unAGlyphs" forces subsetting of fonts, and will not work with SIP/SMP fonts (using characters beyond the Unicode BMP Plane).

mPDF maps these characters to part of the Private Use Area allocated by Unicode U+F500-F7FF. This could interfere with correct use
if the font already utilises these codes (unlikely).

mPDF now deletes U+200C,U+200D,U+200E,U+200F zero-widthjoiner/non-joiner, LTR and RTL marks so they will not appear
even though some fonts contain glyphs for these characters.


Other New features / Improvements
---------------------------------
Avoid just the border/background-color of the (empty) end of a block being moved on to next page (`</div></div>`)
using configurable variable: `$this->margBuffer`;


The TTFontsUni class contained a long function (extractcoreinfo) which is not used routinely in mPDF

This has been moved to a new file: classes/ttfontsuni_analysis.php.

The 3 utility scripts have been updated to use the new extended class:

- utils/font_collections.php
- utils/font_coverage.php
- utils/font_dump.php


Bug fixes
---------
- Border & background when closing 2 blocks (e.g. `</div></div>`) incorrectly being moved to next page because incorrectly
    calculating how much space required
- Fixed/Absolute-positioned elements not inheriting letter-spacing style
- Rotated cell - error if text-rotate set on a table cell, but no text content in cell
- SVG images, text-anchor not working
- Nested table - not resetting cell style (font, color etc) after nested table, if text follows immediately
- Nested table - font-size 70% set in extenal style sheet; if repeated nested tables, sets 70% of 70% etc etc
- SVG setting font-size as percent on successive `<text>` elements gives progressively smaller text
- mPDF will check if magic_quotes_runtime set ON even >= PHP 5.3 (will now cause an error message)
- not resetting after 2 nested tags of same type e.g. `<b><b>bold</b></b>` still bold
- When using charset_in other than utf-8, HTML Footers using tags e.g. `<htmlpageheader>` do not decode correctly
- ToC if nested > 3 levels, line spacing reduces and starts to overlap

Older changes can be seen [on the documentation site](https://mpdf.github.io/about-mpdf/changelog.html).
